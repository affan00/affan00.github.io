In previous days i am getting more familiar with github pages start to know how to raise,close issues in github and how to deploy the changes make on site using gftp. Completed some interesting issues related tasks. Start to became familiar with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and also start to learn RoR. Some familiarities with RoR database (Postgresql), How to create a database, How to access the database etc.
